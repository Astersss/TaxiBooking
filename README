The TaxiBooking API I implemented is using Spring Boot to build the REST API.
I use IntelliJ IDEA for development. Services is written in JAVA. And I use MAVEN to create the application.


How to Build and Execute:
1. Start the Server.
Just click Run inside IntelliJ and wait until server starts: Listen on port 8080.

2. On Mac Download an app called Advanced REST client(ARC) or Postman.
For POST method:
In Request URL field, fill in: http://localhost:8080/api/book

In Parameters field, fill in Header information:
Body content type: select application/json
Editor view: select Raw input.

In Body field, Enter the source and destination you want.
Ex: {
      "source": {
        "x": 9,
        "y": 8
      },
      "destination": {
        "x": 21,
        "y": 80
      }
    }

And click SEND. You will see the expected response!!

The same for api/tick, api/reset

Besides, I add one GET request for you to get the information for all taxis: /api/taxi
